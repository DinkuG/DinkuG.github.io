<!-- FIZZ BUZZ - Create a method that prints the numbers 1 to 100 via a for loop, however if the number it’s outputting is divisible by 3  -->
<!-- then output “Fizz” instead, if the number is divisible by 5 output “Buzz” instead. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, output “FizzBuzz” -->
<!-- Additional – Add 3 additional parameters to your fizz buzz method, one for the number it will count up to, one for the word it outputs if its divisible by 3 and one -->
<!-- for the word it outputs is divisible by 5, then make your application work with these parameters instead of hard-coded values. -->
